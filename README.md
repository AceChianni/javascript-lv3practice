## Instructions

Clone this repository.

Create a branch called `complete`.

Create a branch called `week-1`.

When finished PR into `complete`. You don't need to merge.

Don't merge into `main`!

Don't work on `main` or merge into `main`. Each week, sync with the upstream repo to get the next week's assignment. Create a new branch from `main` for each week as you go.
