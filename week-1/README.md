# Week 1 JavaScript Practice

Factory functions and classes are two common ways to create objects in JavaScript. 

Classes, introduced in ES6, use the class syntax and allow for more structured and standardized object creation. With classes, methods are automatically set on the prototype, making them more memory-efficient. 

We will practice making classes and using them to filter out the data we would get from APIs.

## TODOs

### Checkpoint 1

1. Look at the everyday-objects files (everyday-objects.js and everyday-objects-run.js).
2. Look at the example (Car)
3. Follow the example to create the other objects. (Take car to notice if you log or return a string!)
4. Run them with everyday-objects-run.js
5. Run the tests to see if the tests pass for everyday objects

Note: use `npm test -- -t "Everyday Objects"` to run only the Everyday Objects tests.

Note: use 'q' to exit tests in the terminal.

### Checkpoint 2

1. Look at the EXAMPLE pokemon files (pokemon-run.js and pokemon.js).
2. Run pokemon-run.js with `node pokemon-run.js`
3. Look at the TODO weather files (weather-run.js and weather.js). Find the TODOs
4. Run the tests, and inspect the failing tests for weather. (Ignore the openfoodfacts failing tests for now.)
  * `npm install`
  * `npm test`
5. Complete the TODOs in weather.js
6. run `npm test` and try to make the tests pass for `weather` (Ignore the openfoodfacts failing tests.)

Note: use `npm test -- -t "Pokemon"` to run only the Pokemon tests.
Note: use `npm test -- -t "Weather"` to run only the Weather tests.

### Checkpoint 3

1. Complete the TODOs for OpenFoodFacts.

Note: use `npm test -- -t "OpenFoodFacts"` to run only the Food Facts tests.
