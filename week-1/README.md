# Week 1 JavaScript Practice

Factory functions and classes are two common ways to create objects in JavaScript. 

Classes, introduced in ES6, use the class syntax and allow for more structured and standardized object creation. With classes, methods are automatically set on the prototype, making them more memory-efficient. 

We will practice making classes and using them to filter out the data we would get from APIs.

## TODOS

1. Look at the EXAMPLE pokemon files (pokemon-run.js and pokemon.js).
2. Run pokemon-run.js with `node pokemon-run.js`
3. Look at the TODO weather files (weather-run.js and weather.js). Find the TODOs
4. Run the tests, and inspect the failing tests for weather. (Ignore the openfoodfacts failing testss for now.)
  * `npm install`
  * `npm test`
5. Complete the TODOs in weather.js
6. run `npm test` and try to make the tests pass for `weather` (Ignore the openfoodfacts failing tests.)
7. Complete the TODOs for openfoodfacts.
